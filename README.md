# voxtree
A simple sparse voxel octree implementation in rust.

## project goals
- Providing a simple to use surface API while maximizing performance.
- User specific features like LOD, culling, et al. will be disabled by default.
- Maximal performance on the CPU, examples will be provided for implementation on the GPU but should be simple to use and left up to the user.

## sources
TODO

### made with enthusiasm :)
